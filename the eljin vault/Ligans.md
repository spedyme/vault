a ligand is an atom that forms a [[coordinate bond]] to a central transition metal ion to form a compound by donating a lone pair of electrons

the lone pair is donated to the partially filled d-subshell of a transition metal iion

	

> [!NOTE]
> number of coordinate bonds = lone pairs the ligan is bonded

## Two types of Ligands

| Monodentate       | Polydentate                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1 coordinate bond | 2 or more coordinate bonds |

## Common Ligands
- Water
